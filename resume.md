Lately I've been specializing in **ruby**, **python**, **git**, and **TDD**. I'm always looking for opportunities to learn and grow by working with a team of people smarter than me.

## Work History

### Developer at [Yola](https://www.yola.com/): 2012 - Present

* Helped bring test-driven development to the team. Testing is now a core tenant of the development process.
* Served as the goto "git guru" during the team's transition from svn to git.
* Currently on the company's first project using client-side MVC.

### Independent Consultant: 2004 - 2008, 2010 - 2012

Provided consulting and development services for projects ranging in length from a few months to a few years, both independently and as part of a team for many types of clients:

* Startups like [Wantful](https://wantful.com/)
* Non-profits like [InCharge Education Foundation](http://www.incharge.org/foundation)
* Small businesses like [John's Island Real Estate](http://johnsislandrealestate.com/)
* Large companies like [Chrysler](http://www.chrysler.com/)

### CTO at [Atlantic Dominion Solutions](http://www.railsdevelopment.com/developers/atlantic-dominion-solutions): 2008 - 2010
 
Became the guy who got thrown the big scary projects (read: legacy) that no one else wanted to touch. Led a team of contractors as the company transitioned into a product-based company.

### Lead Developer at 540 Interactive: 2001 - 2004

Helped bring the company from a two-person shop working on small projects to a six-person team taking on larger projects for many clients.
