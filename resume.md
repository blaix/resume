Lately I've been specializing in **object oriented programming** using **ruby**
and **python** with a focus on **test-driven development**.  I'm always looking
for opportunities to learn and grow by working with a team of smart people on
challenging projects that push my limits.

## Experience

I've provided consulting and development services for projects ranging in
length from a few months to a few years, both independently and as part of a
team for many types of clients:

* Startups like [Wantful](https://wantful.com/)
* Non-profits like [InCharge Education Foundation](http://www.incharge.org/foundation)
* Small businesses like [John's Island Real Estate](http://johnsislandrealestate.com/)
* Large companies like [Chrysler](http://www.chrysler.com/)

Using many different technologies:

* Ruby, Python, PHP, and Java
* Rails and Django
* PostgreSQL and MySQL
* Git and SVN
* HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript (with and without frameworks like
  Backbone/Spine/Bootstrap or higher-level abstractions like CoffeeScript,
  Sass/LESS, and HAML)
* Linux, Apache, and Chef

## Work History

### Developer at [Yola](https://www.yola.com/): 2012 - Present

* Helped bring test-driven development to the team. Testing is now a core
  tenant of the development process.
* Served as the goto "git guru" during the team's transition from svn to git.
* Currently on the company's first project using client-side MVC.

### Independent Consultant: 2004 - 2008, 2010 - 2012

Hired both as sole developer and as a team member for projects developed from
the ground up, maintenance on existing projects, rescue projects, code review,
and technical review.

### CTO at [Atlantic Dominion Solutions](http://www.railsdevelopment.com/developers/atlantic-dominion-solutions): 2008 - 2010
 
Became the guy who got thrown the big scary projects (read: legacy) that no one
else wanted to touch. Led a team of contractors as the company transitioned
into a product-based company.

### Lead Developer at 540 Interactive: 2001 - 2004

Helped bring the company from a two-person shop working on small projects to a
six-person team taking on larger projects for many clients. Originally got the
company using version control: starting with CVS and transitioning to
Subversion.
